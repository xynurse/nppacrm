# TODO

Living roadmap. See `docs/SESSION-STATE.md` for the authoritative current
state including in-progress work and known bugs.

Latest shipped commit: `1229900` (UI retheme → indigo/zinc modern-SaaS identity, 2026-07-20) — deployed at `nppacrm.vercel.app`.

## Shipped 2026-07-20 (UI retheme)

- [x] Retheme cyan medical-teal → **indigo** brand + slate → **zinc** neutrals (token-driven cascade) — `1229900`
- [x] New shared `LogoMark` (ascending-bars glyph) replacing the `Activity` heartbeat in sidebar + login
- [x] Near-black zinc sidebar/auth backdrop, translucent top bar, KPI hover polish, dark surfaces → zinc app-wide
- [ ] _(follow-up, not done)_ Visually verify authenticated pages (dashboard/companies/pipeline/drawer) once login is available — recolor is token-cascaded but unverified in-browser this session.
- [ ] _(optional)_ Deeper hand-polish of tables + company drawer (spacing/typography) beyond the color cascade.
- [ ] _(optional)_ Consider full `slate-*` → `zinc-*` sweep for text/borders (currently only surfaces swapped; text/border slate left as-is — visually near-identical).

## Shipped 2026-07-09 (this session)

Platform UX pass:
- [x] Inline keyword search on Companies + Contacts (`q` param, wide match incl. contacts) — `2c35b90`
- [x] Pipeline search box + open/edit company drawer in place on `/pipeline` — `93bb3d7`
- [x] Dashboard boxes drill into filtered views; fixed `is_one_of` filter crash — `c0c7608`
- [x] `/event` event profile page + "Event" nav item — `b1357b5`

Contact email history:
- [x] Contact email-history capture + archive (drawer "Previous emails") — `e353f9c`
  - [ ] **Apply migration 0010** (`contact_email_history`) to prod — `pnpm db:migrate`
    (blocked: user couldn't run it this session). Code degrades gracefully
    until applied; feature is live once the table exists. **Next session: verify.**

Bounced-email tracking:
- [x] `BOUNCED` tag convention + red **Bounced** badge (table / pipeline / drawer) — `cdfc16e`
- [x] Tags column + Tags filter (contains/equals/empty) on the companies table — `85abac1`
- [x] Bounced overlay bar on the dashboard pipeline funnel — `a0cca97`
- [ ] _(follow-up, not built)_ select-style tag picker in the filter UI; bulk "clear BOUNCED" action after an email is fixed.

Data-only (no commit):
- [x] Outreach batch 1 — 66 fresh prospects logged as contacted
- [x] Outreach batch 2 — 16 delivered → contacted; 24 undeliverable → BOUNCED tag + note + follow-up task
- [x] 9 more companies tagged BOUNCED (33 total carry the tag)

## Critical path: remaining setup

- [x] Rebuild from spec (chunks 1–19 complete)
- [x] Push to GitHub
- [x] Provision Neon + run migrations (0000–0009 applied)
- [x] Vercel project + env vars wired
- [x] Vercel Blob integration installed
- [x] First deploy live
- [x] Admin account created (mike@thorn.ooo)
- [x] `pnpm db:seed` run (LPD 2026 event + tiers + default views)
- [ ] **Connect Anthropic provider in Vercel AI Gateway** (unlocks AI enrichment)
- [x] `/admin/events/[id]/import` to bulk-load real Master List CSV
  - Importer extended to full Master List fidelity (commits 9776150, 2b43f88);
    converter at `scripts/excel-to-import-csv.py`; CSV generated to Desktop.
  - [ ] **Run the actual data load** — admin uploads
    `~/Desktop/NPPA_LPD_2026_master_list_import.csv` via the import UI (312 rows).
- [ ] **Custom domain** _(deferred — pending final name decision)_

## Surfaced from Master List import (deferred — "just migrate for now")

- [ ] **Category as a structured field + grouped "By Category" view** — workbook
  has 24 categories and a dedicated category sheet; CRM only has free-text
  `industry`. Surface `subcategory` (currently in `customFields`) as a column.
- [ ] **Payment & fulfillment fields + Confirmed Sponsors view** — agreement
  signed / invoice sent / paid / booth # / rep names (workbook's Confirmed
  Sponsors sheet). Needs a migration adding columns to `event_companies`.

## v1 chunks to rebuild (in order)

These were all built and verified before the worktree was deleted. Order is
load-bearing — chunk N depends on chunks 1..N-1.

- [x] Chunk 1 — Foundation (Next 15, TS strict, Tailwind v4, Drizzle/Neon, env validation, ESLint, CI)
- [x] Chunk 2 — Auth + admin shell + events + audit log (migration 0000)
- [x] Chunk 3 — Companies + eventCompanies + table + drawer skeleton (migration 0001)
- [x] Chunk 4 — Inline-editable cells (9 types)
- [x] Chunk 5 — Contacts + interactions + tasks + reviews (migration 0002)
- [x] Chunk 6 — Saved views + filter chips + sort (migration 0003)
- [x] Chunk 7 — Kanban + `/pipeline`
- [x] Chunk 8 — Custom fields + Vercel Blob file uploads (migration 0004)
- [x] Chunk 9 — ⌘K palette + global keyboard shortcuts (migration 0005)
- [x] Chunk 10 — Dashboard + CSV import/export + admin tiers
- [x] Chunk 11 — Audit page + soft-delete recovery + mobile polish
- [x] Chunk 12 — Playwright e2e + bundle polish (drop framer-motion)
      framer-motion was never reintroduced in the rebuild; nothing to drop.
      typedRoutes still off — every dynamic href would need a `Route` cast
      (14+ sites). Tracked under "Bundle / perf debt" below.

## v1.5 chunks to rebuild (after v1 + first deploy)

- [x] Chunk 13 — Prospectus ingest + on-demand AI enrichment (migration 0006)
      Built with AI SDK v6 + Vercel AI Gateway (model id strings) and Valyu
      web search. Needs manual `pnpm db:migrate` against prod after merge
      AND env keys (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VALYU_API_KEY`,
      optional `AI_DAILY_SPEND_CAP_USD=2`) before the AI features actually run.
- [x] Chunk 14 — Discovery agent (manual run, migration 0009) — Watch agent deferred to 14b
- [x] Chunk 17 — Benefits tracking (migration 0007 in this rebuild — was 0008
      in the original lost chunk plan, but ordering shifted since chunk 14
      hasn't been built yet)
      Auto-instantiates `tier.benefits` onto event_companies when a prospect
      hits `confirmed` via any of the four confirm paths (pipeline modal,
      kanban drag, inline status cell). Needs `pnpm db:migrate` after merge.
- [x] Chunk 18 — Proposal flow + cadence warnings (migration 0008 in
      this rebuild — ordering shifted from the original chunk plan)
      `markProposalSent` action sets proposal_url/sent_at/valid_until,
      flips status, bumps lastContactedAt, auto-creates 7-day follow-up
      task. Drawer header "Mark proposal sent" dialog. /companies Last
      contact cell tints amber at 14+ days, red at 30+ for active
      statuses. Needs `pnpm db:migrate` after merge.

## Post-v1 lettered chunks (new work on top of the rebuild)

- [x] **Chunk A — Medical design system** (2026-06-01)
  Dark slate sidebar, teal brand colour (`brand-600`), Inter font, refined
  typography and spacing throughout.

- [x] **UI polish phase 2** (2026-07-02)
  Elevation token system + `surface-card` utility, dark-mode class-toggle fix,
  Button loading state, input focus glow, sidebar left-indicator nav,
  inline-edit pencil affordance, kanban hover/drop states, drawer tab +
  Outreach-strategy accent, command palette polish. Plus: `older_than_n_days`
  filter op (fixes inverted Stale view → "Needs follow-up"),
  `proposalValidUntil` filterable + "Proposals expiring soon" seed view,
  `/` and `g r` shortcuts.

- [x] **Chunk B — Outreach intelligence & UX enrichment** (2026-06-01)
  Dashboard v2 (funnel chart, tier mix, hot prospects, richer KPIs), contact
  creation with company picker, task timeline view + New Task form with
  assignee, pipeline cards with last-contact age tinting, AI email draft
  action + modal in company drawer, "Discover" nav link in admin sidebar.

- [x] **Chunk 14b — Watch agent + Vercel cron**
  Watch agent monitors active prospects for signals → creates follow-up tasks.
  Shipped: `vercel.json` daily crons, `/api/cron/{discovery,watch}` routes with
  `CRON_SECRET` Bearer auth, `runWatchAgent` action, Watch row live in agents UI.

## Chunk C — Natural-language updates ("AI quick update") — ✅ DONE (2026-07-08, commit fdddf09)

Shipped: `lib/ai/nl-update.ts` (model layer), `lib/actions/nl-update.ts`
(`proposeNlUpdate` read-only + `applyNlUpdate` through existing actions),
`components/ai/nl-update-dialog.tsx` + `nl-update-box.tsx`, wired into the ⌘K
palette and dashboard. Whitelisted ops only, `confirmed` routed to the confirm
modal, unmatched companies flagged. No migration. typecheck/lint/build green.
**Still needs** the AI provider enabled with credits in Vercel prod before it
works live (gateway returns `403 byok_requires_paid_credits` until then). See
CHANGELOG for detail.

Original spec (for reference):

Type plain English in the app ("Met with Boston Scientific, they want the
Gold prospectus; Stryker no reply to 2nd email"), AI proposes structured CRM
updates, user confirms before anything is written. In-app version of the
`/sync-outreach` Claude Code skill.

- **Input surface:** new "AI update" entry in the ⌘K palette + a box on the
  dashboard. Textarea, submit → loading → proposal review.
- **Server action** (`lib/actions/ai.ts` or new `lib/actions/nl-update.ts`):
  send user text + the event's prospect list (id, company name, status) to
  Claude via the existing AI Gateway plumbing (reuse chunk 13 patterns:
  model resolution, spend cap, `generateObject`/structured output).
- **Structured output schema (Zod)** — the model may ONLY propose whitelisted
  ops per matched company: `set_status` (enum), `log_interaction` (type,
  subject, body, occurredAt), `bump_last_contacted`, `set_next_action_at`,
  `create_task` (title, dueDate, priority). Plus `unmatched: string[]` for
  company mentions it couldn't resolve. No deletes, no amount/tier writes.
- **Confirmation UI:** diff card per company with individually toggleable
  items + Apply button. Unmatched mentions shown as warnings. `confirmed`
  status proposals redirect the user to the existing confirm modal (amount +
  tier + benefits must stay atomic).
- **Apply path:** accepted items call the EXISTING server actions
  (`logInteraction`, `updateField`, task create) so audit rows, optimistic
  UI, and validation come free. New audit action `ai.nl_update_apply` for
  the batch summary.
- **Prereq:** `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` set in Vercel prod (dashboard → AI tab →
  connect Anthropic) or the feature 503s in production. Set `CRON_SECRET`
  while in there (crons currently 500).
- No DB migration needed.

## v1.5 — never built (still on the wishlist)

Listed in approximate decreasing-leverage order.

- ~~**Per-event branding**~~ _(removed from scope 2026-05-28)_

- [x] **Chunk 19 — Reports page**
  - Conversion funnel (cumulative ever-reached counts + stage-to-stage %)
  - Owner leaderboard (companies, confirmed $, proposed $, interactions)
  - Tier mix (confirmed count + $ per tier; target counts)
  - Revenue rollup (confirmed / proposed / expected vs goal, gap, %)
  - Cadence breakdown (ok / amber 14+d / red 30+d)
  - Average days in stage (computed from audit_log move_status entries)
  - CSV export per section + full-summary export
  - **Deferred**: PDF export. Not shipped because it would pull a heavy
    headless-Chromium / pdf-lib dep for a feature your team can get with
    "Save as PDF" in the browser. Easy to add later if needed.

- ~~**Renewal radar**~~ _(removed from scope 2026-05-28)_

- [x] **Chunk 23 — Polish**
  - AND/OR filter toggle on filter-bar (connector between chips toggles
    global op; FilterAst.op is now "and"|"or", compiler handles both)
  - Sort on column headers (click cycles: off → asc → desc → off;
    sort icons use ArrowUp/Down/UpDown; pushes ?s= URL param)
  - Column-picker per session (Columns button in toolbar, ?col= URL param,
    pinned: companyName always visible)
  - "Pending Team Review" hasPendingReview field with is_true/is_false
    operators backed by EXISTS subquery on event_reviewers
  - Deferred: drag-reorder of views/fields, Recharts pace chart upgrade

- [ ] **Chunk 22 — More custom-field types**
  - multiSelect, datetime, rating, person, relation
  - Surface custom fields as TABLE COLUMNS (drawer-only in chunk 8)
  - Custom-field filter operators in the FilterBar
    (`field: 'custom:fieldKey'` with type-aware jsonb predicates)

- [ ] **Chunk 20 — Notification center**
  - Bell icon in top bar
  - `notifications` table + dropdown UI
  - Triggers: `@mentions` (needs TipTap first), task assignments, status
    changes on owned companies

- [ ] **Chunk 14b — Watch agent + Vercel cron wiring**
  - Discovery agent shipped in chunk 14 (manual run only); the Watch agent
    schedule slot existed but the agent itself was just sketched
  - Need Vercel cron wiring (or Vercel Workflow for durable execution)
  - Watch monitors existing prospects for news / leadership / fundraising
    signals via Valyu, surfaces as enrichment suggestions

- [ ] **Chunk 15 — TipTap rich notes**
  - Replace `interactions.body`, `tasks.description` text columns with
    jsonb TipTap docs
  - Add `companies.notesDoc` for long-form notes
  - Slash commands, `@` mentions (powers chunk 20), `#` linked records,
    autosave on debounce

- [ ] **Chunk 16 — Calendar + Gallery views**
  - New view kinds in the existing saved-views machinery
  - Calendar for tasks (by due) / interactions (by occurredAt) / companies
    (by nextActionAt)
  - Gallery card grid for visual browsing

- [ ] **Chunk 21 — Real-time presence + Pusher**
  - Flip `REALTIME_ENABLED=true`, wire Pusher creds
  - Avatar dots on open records
  - Cell flash on remote edit
  - Lock indicator while another user is editing
  - Re-uses existing optimistic-UI plumbing — adapter pattern

## v2 — later

From the original spec's "v2 (later)" list, never chunked:

- [ ] Email send + IMAP sync (Resend)
- [ ] Google Calendar sync
- [ ] Workflow automations (when X happens, do Y)
- [ ] Public read-only share links
- [ ] Custom objects beyond the built-ins
- [ ] Two-factor auth
- [ ] Multi-conference / multi-tenant accounts (separate orgs)
- [ ] Sequences / playbooks
- [ ] Custom dashboards

## Bundle / perf debt (carried over from the lost build)

- [ ] `/companies` is 240 kB First Load JS — 40 kB over target
  - Biggest weight: the cell editor module (~12 cells loaded eagerly)
  - Remediation: `next/dynamic` import per cell type so only used cells load
- [ ] Re-enable `experimental.typedRoutes` in `next.config.ts` after
      chunk 12 (was off during the chunked build because chunks 3–11 added
      routes one-by-one)
- [ ] Migrate `next lint` → `eslint .` flat config (Next 16 deprecation)

## Operational

- [ ] One-time `pnpm approve-builds --all` per machine (configured in
      `package.json#pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` but local approval is
      per-machine)
- [ ] Decide retention for `agentRuns` and `enrichmentJobs` (currently
      indefinite — could grow if agents run daily)
- [ ] Document Anthropic + Valyu API key rotation policy
