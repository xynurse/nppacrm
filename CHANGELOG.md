# Changelog

## Active build (committed to main)

### Chunk C — Natural-language "AI quick update" _(2026-07-08, commit fdddf09)_
- In-app version of the `/sync-outreach` Claude Code skill. Paste a plain-English
  outreach recap; Claude proposes whitelisted, structured CRM updates per matched
  company; the user reviews individually-toggleable diff cards; accepted items are
  written through the **existing** server actions so audit rows, validation, and
  cache revalidation all come for free. Nothing is written until Apply.
- `lib/ai/nl-update.ts` — model layer (Zod proposal schema + `runNlUpdate`),
  mirroring `lib/ai/gateway.ts`. Whitelisted ops only: `set_status`,
  `log_interaction`, `bump_last_contacted`, `set_next_action_at`, `create_task`.
  Never deletes, never writes amount/tier; unknown company mentions go to
  `unmatched` instead of being guessed. Uses `AI_MODEL_ID` (currently Opus 4.7).
- `lib/actions/nl-update.ts` — `proposeNlUpdate` (read-only: AI-config gate +
  daily spend-cap pre-flight, loads the active event's prospects, drops
  hallucinated ids, audit `ai.nl_update_propose`) and `applyNlUpdate`
  (re-validates the whitelist server-side, dispatches to
  `moveEventCompanyStatus` / `logInteraction` / `updateField` / `createTask`,
  batch audit `ai.nl_update_apply`). `confirmed` is skipped and routed to the
  pipeline confirm modal so amount + tier + benefits stay atomic.
- `components/ai/nl-update-dialog.tsx` — input → loading → toggleable review
  cards + unmatched warnings → apply → per-company summary.
- `components/ai/nl-update-box.tsx` — dashboard entry box (parses on submit).
- Wired into the ⌘K palette (Actions group) and the dashboard header.
- No DB migration. typecheck + lint + build green. Read-only propose path
  verified end-to-end against the live gateway; the write path and live model
  output need the AI provider enabled **with credits** in Vercel (the gateway
  currently returns `403 byok_requires_paid_credits` — same prereq that gates
  enrichment / email-draft / agents).

### Admin password recovery script _(2026-07-02)_
- `scripts/reset-admin-password.ts` — resets a user's password by email
  (bcrypt cost 12, matching the seed). For recovering admin access when the
  original `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is lost — it's stored as a Vercel *sensitive*
  env var, so it can't be read back. Run manually:
  `RESET_EMAIL=… RESET_PASSWORD=… pnpm tsx scripts/reset-admin-password.ts`.
  Targets whatever `DATABASE_URL` points at; no plaintext is ever stored.

### UI polish phase 2 + view/filter quick wins _(2026-07-02)_
- **Elevation system** (`app/globals.css`): three shadow tiers
  (`--shadow-card`/`--shadow-raised`/`--shadow-overlay`, dark-aware),
  `--ease-out-soft` easing, and `surface-card`/`surface-card-hover`/`kbd-chip`
  utilities. Dashboard cards, tables, drawer, palette, and dialogs now share
  one consistent depth language.
- **Dark-mode toggle fixed**: `dark:` variants and the semantic CSS vars were
  keyed to `prefers-color-scheme`, but next-themes toggles a `.dark` class —
  the in-app theme toggle did nothing. Added `@custom-variant dark` and moved
  the var/body overrides to `.dark`, so light/dark/system all work.
- **Primitives**: Button gains a `loading` prop (spinner + disable), press
  scale, hover elevation; Input/Select get soft focus glow (brand ring + border)
  and hover border states.
- **Chrome**: sidebar active nav is now a teal left-indicator + subtle tint
  (was a solid block); top bar has a hairline shadow.
- **Tables**: inline-edit cells show a pencil affordance + brand tint on hover
  and a ring while editing; rows get a hover accent rail; richer empty state
  with icon and guidance.
- **Kanban**: cards lift on hover, drop-target columns glow teal, empty
  columns invite a drop.
- **Command palette / cheat sheet**: overlay shadow + scale-in, teal accent bar
  on the selected item, `kbd-chip` hints.
- **Drawer**: overlay shadow + eased slide, brand-underline tabs, and the
  Outreach section is now an accented "Outreach strategy" card (gradient tint +
  sparkles) so AI-enriched content stands out.
- **New filter operator `older_than_n_days`** (types, zod schema, compiler,
  filter bar). Fixes the seeded "Stale (no contact 14+ days)" view, which used
  `last_n_days` and matched *recently contacted* companies — the opposite of
  stale. Replaced by "Needs follow-up (14+ days)" (existing DBs keep the old
  view; delete it manually and re-run seed, or recreate via the filter bar).
- **`proposalValidUntil` is now filterable/sortable** + new default view
  "Proposals expiring soon" (proposal_sent/negotiating with proposal expiry in
  the next 14 days).
- **Shortcuts**: `/` opens the palette, `g r` → Reports; cheat sheet updated.

### Master List CSV import — full-fidelity importer _(2026-06-02, commits 9776150, 2b43f88)_
- `lib/actions/csv.ts` — the prospect importer now ingests the whole NPPA
  Master List instead of 7 fields. Added columns: `website`, `subcategory`,
  `owner`, `target_tier`, the four AI outreach fields (`why_they_should_attend`,
  `key_talking_points`, `email_angle`, `sponsorship_hook`), `relationship_notes`,
  `first_contacted_at`, `last_contacted_at`, and `contact1_*`/`contact2_*`.
  Owner resolves by user name/email, tier by name within the event, contacts are
  created (contact 1 = primary) deduped by email/name, and `subcategory` is
  stored in `eventCompanies.customFields`. Unmatched owner → unassigned (null).
- `components/admin/import-wizard.tsx` — parsed-row shape, header aliases, and
  help text expanded to match.
- `scripts/excel-to-import-csv.py` — workbook → importer-ready CSV converter
  (status/tier remap, `hq_location` composition, owner alias `Michael`→`Mike
  Thorn`). Generated CSV is kept out of git (contact PII).
- Data load itself is a manual step (admin runs it via the import UI).

### Chunk 14b — Watch agent + Vercel cron _(2026-06-01)_
- `lib/agents/watch.ts` — Watch agent: for each active prospect runs a Valyu
  search for recent news/funding/leadership signals, calls Claude Haiku to
  assess signal relevance, creates a follow-up task on the company if a real
  signal is found. Max 10 companies/run, skips terminal statuses and anyone
  contacted within the last 7 days.
- `app/api/cron/discovery/route.ts` — GET handler with Bearer auth, runs
  discovery for all active events where the Discovery agent is enabled.
- `app/api/cron/watch/route.ts` — GET handler with Bearer auth, runs watch
  for all active events where the Watch agent is enabled.
- `vercel.json` — daily cron schedule (Discovery 6am UTC, Watch 8am UTC).
- `lib/actions/agents.ts` — `runWatchAgent` server action added.
- `components/admin/agents-panel.tsx` — Watch row live with toggle, Run now,
  and a signal-task-count badge.
- `lib/env.ts` / `.env.example` — `CRON_SECRET` added (required in prod).

### Chunk B — Outreach intelligence & UX enrichment _(2026-06-01, commit d756c6a)_
- **Dashboard v2:** colour-accented KPI cards, horizontal pipeline funnel bar
  chart, tier-mix confirmed-revenue breakdown, hot-prospects panel (high
  priority + active status), activity feed with user initials.
- **Contact creation:** "New contact" button on `/contacts` with searchable
  company picker; marks primary contact; empty-state copy updated.
- **Task management:** timeline view grouping tasks into Overdue / Today /
  This Week / Later / No Due Date buckets with colour banding. List ↔
  Timeline toggle. Standalone "New task" inline form with due date, priority,
  and assignee picker across all active users.
- **Pipeline cards:** last-contacted date shown per card; amber at 14d, red
  at 30d (matches cadence logic in companies table).
- **AI email draft:** `draftOutreachEmail` server action (Claude Sonnet, cached
  prospectus context, company profile + CRM notes + primary contact). Drawer
  header button opens modal with subject + body, per-field copy buttons,
  full-email copy, regenerate. System-prompt rules block AI slop phrasing.
- **Discover nav link:** admin sidebar item pointing straight to the AI agents
  page for the active event.

### Chunk A — Medical design system _(2026-06-01, commit 4e71273)_
- Dark slate sidebar (`bg-slate-900`) matching clinical/enterprise aesthetic.
- Teal brand colour (`brand-600 = #0d9488`, teal-600) replacing generic blue.
- Inter font via `next/font/google` with `--font-inter` CSS variable.
- Refined typography scale and spacing throughout shell components.

  6 months before next event)

### Chunk 17 — Benefits tracking _(2026-05-09)_
- `companyBenefits` table with `benefit_status` enum
  (pending / in_progress / delivered / skipped)
- `instantiateBenefits` action — copies `tier.benefits` jsonb into per-prospect
  rows; idempotent by `benefitKey`; due dates computed from
  `event.startDate + tier.benefits[].defaultDueOffsetDays`
- `confirmEventCompany` auto-instantiates after successful confirm
- Drawer **Benefits tab** — list with status select, due-date display,
  delete, and "Instantiate" / "Sync from tier" buttons. Only renders when
  status is `confirmed` or benefits already exist.

### Chunk 14 — Background agents _(2026-05-09)_
- `agentSchedules`, `agentRuns`, `companySuggestions` tables
- `runDiscoveryNow` server action — Opus 4.7 + prospectus context →
  proposes 5–8 NEW candidate companies (skipping already-prospected)
- `acceptCompanySuggestion` — creates company + eventCompany on accept
- `dismissCompanySuggestion` — soft-rejects with audit trail
- `toggleAgent` — enable/disable Discovery + Watch agents per event
- `/admin/events/[id]/agents` page — toggle controls, manual run, suggestions
  inbox, recent run history with cost

- `acceptSuggestion` / `rejectSuggestion` — admin-reviewed; only writes to
  whitelisted outreach fields (whyTheyShouldAttend / keyTalkingPoints /
  emailAngle / sponsorshipHook)
- Drawer **AI tab** — pending suggestion count badge, source URLs,
  confidence display, accept/reject actions
- Drawer header **"Enrich with AI"** button
- `/admin/events/[id]/prospectus` — PDF upload (Blob), extracted text, delete
- All AI calls gate on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `VALYU_API_KEY` — no surprise
  costs without explicit env config

## Lessons learned (from the lost build)

- **Commit each chunk as it lands.** The whole build was lost because
  nothing was committed and the worktree was deleted. Default to "commit
  after every green build" going forward.
- **`pnpm` lives at `/Users/michaelthorn/.npm-global/bin/pnpm`** —
  prepend PATH for every Bash invocation.
- **`pnpm 11` requires `pnpm approve-builds --all`** once per machine for
  esbuild/sharp/unrs-resolver postinstall scripts. Configured in
  `package.json#pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` but the local approval cache
  is per-machine.
- **`types/next-auth.d.ts` must stay under `types/`** (not project root,
  not same name as a package).
- **JWT module augmentation must target `@auth/core/jwt`** — `next-auth/jwt`
  re-exports from there, but augmentation only sticks at the source module.
- **`experimental.typedRoutes` must be OFF during the chunked build** —
  routes are added one chunk at a time; safe to re-enable in a later polish
  chunk.
- **Drizzle migrations need manual SQL appends** for trigram extensions, GIN
  indexes, partial indexes. Add an entry to `_meta/_journal.json` so
  `db:migrate` picks them up. Do NOT use `db:push` — it bypasses manual
  appends.
- **Edit tool blocks writes to files not previously Read in the same
  session** — Read before Edit even after editing the file in earlier turns.
- **Dynamic import inside a server action** is a clean way to avoid
  circular module deps in actions that hook into other actions
  (e.g. `confirmEventCompany` → `instantiateBenefits`).
